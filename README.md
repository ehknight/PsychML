# PsychLearning

In this notebook, I apply some machine learning techniques (supervised learning, LIME, unsupervised clustering, neural networks) to classifying ADHD-ness. Data taken from a separate source not included in repo. Currently I'm working with computed data but when I get the raw data I plan to apply other exciting techniques, such as LSTM neural networks.
